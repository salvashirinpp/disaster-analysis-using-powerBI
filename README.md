# ***Natural Disaster Impact Analysis Dashboard — Power BI***

A Data-Driven Approach to Understanding Disaster Severity, Human Impact & Economic Losses

## Project Overview

This project presents an interactive Power BI dashboard that analyzes the frequency, severity, and impact of natural disasters across multiple states. By cleaning, transforming, and modeling the dataset, the dashboard provides a clear understanding of how different disaster events affect human life and the economy.

The goal is to support data-driven decision-making for disaster preparedness, resource allocation, and risk assessment.

## Methodology

### 1. Data Cleaning & Preparation

Removed duplicate records and invalid entries

Standardized date formats and corrected data types

Handled missing values for event, location, and fatality records

Normalized state and event names for consistent mapping

### 2. Data Modeling

Established relationships between:

Event Table

Location Table

Fatality Table

Built optimized data schema for faster slicer/filter response

Created DAX measures for:

Total Deaths

Total Injuries

Economic Loss

Event-wise and State-wise summaries

### 3. Visualization Development

Developed a comprehensive visual analytics report using:

Map Visuals → Disaster spread by location

Bar & Column Charts → Top harmful event types

Donut Charts → Distribution of deaths/injuries

KPI Cards → Quick insights on total events & damage

Slicers → State-wise and event-wise filtering

## Key Insights

Total Events: 7,642 natural disaster occurrences

Human Impact: 53 fatalities and 161 injuries

Most Harmful Event Types: Flash Flood, Tornado, Thunderstorm Wind

High-Risk States: Utah, Arizona, Illinois, Colorado, Florida

Economic Damage: Over $3.4 billion in losses

Demographic Insight: Most fatalities occurred among male individuals

These insights highlight which regions and event types pose the highest threat—critical for early warning systems and emergency resource planning.

## Conclusion

This dashboard offers a powerful analytical view of disaster trends and impacts. By identifying high-risk states, dangerous event types, and the financial burden of natural disasters, it serves as a valuable tool for:

Government agencies

Disaster risk management teams

Policy makers

Public safety organizations

It supports proactive planning, efficient resource allocation, and improved disaster response strategies to minimize future losses.
