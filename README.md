`Brief Project Explanation`

This Power BI dashboard analyzes natural disaster events across different states. The data was cleaned, transformed, and modeled to create a clear view of how disasters impact people and the economy.

`Methodology:`

The dataset was cleaned (removing duplicates, fixing dates, correcting data types), relationships were created between event, location, and fatality tables, and meaningful measures such as total deaths, injuries, and economic losses were calculated. Visuals like maps, bar charts, and donut charts were used for clear interpretation.

`Insights:`

A total of 7,642 disasters occurred, causing 53 fatalities and 161 injuries.

Flash Flood, Tornado, and Thunderstorm Wind were among the most harmful event types.

Certain states like Utah, Arizona, Illinois, Colorado, and Florida showed higher death/injury counts.

Economic losses exceeded $3.4 billion, mainly due to debris flow, heavy rain, and thunderstorm-related events.

Most fatalities were recorded among male individuals.

`Conclusion:`

The dashboard helps identify high-risk event types, vulnerable states, and the financial burden of disasters. These insights support better planning, disaster preparedness, and resource allocation to reduce future human and economic impacts.
